Canary UI
==============

This is a flat build out of the ember.js app for the Canary front end. It will need to be pulled into CQ.

Installation
---

This project relies on Grunt. From the project's root directory, type 'npm install' to get the dependencies, then type 'grunt' to run the default grunt job, which builds the project. To view it, use 'grunt server'.

If the grunt commands fail, you may need to install the grunt-cli package using npm.
